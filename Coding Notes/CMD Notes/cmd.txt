Basic Commands for Mac, Linux, Cmder

Preset working directory:
pwd
(Use this command any time you are unsure where you are currently in your file structure. 
pwd stands for Present Working Directory. For Windows, you may either use pwd or cd.)


List Files:
ls 
(Use the ls command to see all the directories and files that are in your current directory. 
To clear things up, a directory is just a synonym for a folder. In 'cmd', use the dir command instead.)


List files (long form):
ls -1
(Use the 'ls -l' command to see a long form, 
representation of the directories and files inside your current directory)


List all files (long form):
ls -a
(USe the 'is -a command to see ALL the files.)


Changing to the current directory:
cd .
(From the previous command, we saw that 'ls - a' will list some interesting file names like '.' and '..' The '.' is reserved to represent the current directory that we are in. 
If you run the 'cd . ' and then run the 'pwd' command, you'll see that we didn't move to a different directory. 
We told the computer to change our directory to our current directory which means don't go anywhere! The cd command works well in 'cmd' as well.)


Changing to the parent directory: 
cd ..
(Like the 'cd . ' command, the '..' is reserved to represent the parent directory of the current folder that we are in. 
If you run this command and then run the 'pwd' command, you'll see that we navigated up one directory(folder) structure. 
If you feel like the File Structure is starting to resemble the DOM (Document Object Model), it's because they are very similar.)


Changing to any folder:
cs folder_name
(the 'cd' command followed by a space and name of the folder you want to access will move you into the directory, if it exists.
This example would move you into the 'folder_name" directory.)
